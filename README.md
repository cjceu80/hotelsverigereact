Based on a group project with the goal to create a visual design of a website for searching and booking hotels, where I acted as lead programmer. Later I have remade the project using bootstrap instead of a large css.

Many of the menu alternatives are not implemented as the assignment was to implement a frontend for searching and booking. Hotel information is provided by a firebase database and the booking is only fictional without any backend.
